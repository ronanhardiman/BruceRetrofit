ResultReceiver - Generic callback interface for sending results between service and activity. If your service only needs to connect with its parent application in a single place, use this approach.
BroadcastReceiver - Used to create a generic broadcast event which can then be picked up by any application. If your service needs to communicate with multiple components that want to listen for communication, use this approach.
